# Project 2

# Topic: blog articles - mediastack

## My Contribution to the team:
- [X] First i created an account at the mediaStack website to get an API access Key. To check the Key, [ClickHere](images/Leon_APIdashboard.png)
- [X] With the API, I could read the documentation to see how the API should be settled up
- [X] Using the "Run API Request" I could check what kind of data would be retrieved from the API. To check a print screen of the API Request, [ClickHere](images/APIrequest.png)
- [X] The group worked in a folder inside GitHub, so we worked all the time together. Oluwole started coding the JS file, HTML and CSS. My contribution was focused on the JS file. Basically, I broke down the code into smaller async functions, so we could have one function to fetch the data, another one to load the articles and a third one to display it in the HTML.

## Learning curve and challenges
- [X] Although the media stack website kept saying that the all systems were [operational](images/media_operation.png), sometimes the API request was not working. So, sometimes when we were testing the HTML, the page wouldn't upload because we kept receiving the error: {"error":{"code":"https_access_restricted","message":"Access Restricted - Your current Subscription Plan does not support HTTPS Encryption."}} . To check the print screen, [ClickHere](images/APIrequestFailed.png)
- [X] We started working as soon as the project was realeased, but the erorr message start comming 

## Conclusion
- [X] The project had its fair share of challenges, such as the API not always working and the error messages that came with it. 
- [X] Despite we had these challenges, Oluwole and I were able to work together in a collaborative manner. I think that the output that we developed looks nice and would be ready for a first realease.
