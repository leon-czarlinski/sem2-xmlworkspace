## My Contribution to the team:
- [X] I created the HTML File [ClickHere](index.html) and first version of the JS file [ClickHere](app.js) that makes an HTTP request to the MediaStack API which then display the news/article content on the HTML webpage

- [X] I created the style.css [ClickHere](style.css) file to customize the HTML page I created earlier just to make the page appealing.

## Learning curve and challenges
- [X] One major challenge I faced was the error message "Access Restricted - Your current Subscription Plan does not support HTTPS Encryption." Even when running the API on HTTP. Took a whole lot of time for me to realize that the issue isn't with my code, rather it's an issue with the MediaStack subscription plan.
- [X] In addition to this, I've also had to learn how to use the MediaStack API, how to make requests to the Mediastack using PHP REST API, and how to display the results on websites that are running on custom CMS.

## Conclusion
- [X] Overall, We were able to overcome these challenges even though We can't control the situation where the end point URL is forced to serve requests on HTTPS most times, becuase our type of subscription is a free plan which does not support HTTPS request.

But all in all, We successfully created two different versions of the script that accesses the MediaStack API and displays the results on a webpage. As you can see in the images folder the results.
