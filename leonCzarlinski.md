# Project 1
# Leon Czarlinski
# Topic: Construction

## My Contribution to the team:
- [X] We worked using a git repository that I created. Using git gave us the hability to practice even more how to use the tool
- [X] I started working on the json file, transforming the data to the xml file. 
- [X] Check how the information got organized in the [XML](construction.xml) 
- [X] Check how the XML is validated [Here](XML_Validation.png)
- [X] Oluwole worked on the DTD, XSL and XSLT. I helped to validate using the online tool and to correct some errors before we got the validation without errors. 
- [X] To check the prints with validation: [DTDValidation](DTD_Validation.png) and [XSDValidation](XSD_Validation.png)
- [X] Since we both wanted to have the experience to work on the HTML and JavaScript, we decided to work on two HTMLs. I worked on the displayConstruction2. To access the folder [ClickHere](/displayConstruction2/)
- [X] In the displayConstruction2 I worked with three different files for the the visualization: the [HTML](/displayConstruction2/displayConstruction2.html), the [CSS](/displayConstruction2/style.css) and the [JavaScript](/displayConstruction2/script.js)

To see how the visualization ended up [ClickHere](displayConstruction2.png)


## Learning curve and challenges
- [X] The part of transforming from json to xml was hard working, because some elements I had to write again (ex. each worker inside workers, each equipment inside equipments and each material inside supplies)
- [X] Working with the HTML was very challenging this time, because the idea was to display all the information avaiable. Since workers, equipments and supply had child elemnts, it was challengin to come up with a solution to insert the info inside of differents tables. To do so, I had to create other const with [] and push in a different way. Each step in coding with javascript was challenging, but I could learn a lot. 
- [X] During the process I had the chance to see some extra materials and learn more about creating functions in java script
- [X] Also, I wanted to try writing the script inside of the js file, so I could practice more the link between HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Conclusion
Althought it was challenging, the project made sense and helped me a lot to work on javascript skills. Also helped me a lot to work using github and get used to the tool
